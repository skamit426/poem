Stars of the summer night!

    Far in yon azure deeps,

Hide, hide your golden light,

    She sleeps!

My lady sleeps!

      Sleeps!



Moon of the summer night!

    Far down yon western steeps,

Sink, sink in silver light!

    She sleeps!

My lady sleeps!

      Sleeps!



Wind of the summer night!

    Where yonder woodbine creeps,

Fold, fold your pinions light!

    She sleeps!

My lady sleeps!

      Sleeps!



Dreams of the summer night!

    Tell her, her lover keeps

Watch! while in slumber light

    She sleeps!

My lady sleeps!

      Sleeps!



            Enter Victorian by the balcony.

  Victorian. Poor little dove! Thou tremblest like a leaf!

  Pre. I am so frightened!—’Tis for thee I tremble!

I hate to have thee climb that wall by night!

Did no one see thee?

  Vic. None, my love, but thou.

  Pre. ’Tis very dangerous; and when thou’rt gone

I chide myself for letting thee come here

Thus stealthily by night. Where hast thou been?

Since yesterday I have no news from thee.

  Vic. Since yesterday I’ve been in Alcalá.

Ere long the time will come, sweet Preciosa,

When that dull distance shall no more divide us;

And I no more shall scale thy wall by night

To steal a kiss from thee, as I do now.

  Pre. An honest thief, to steal but what thou givest.

  Vic. And we shall sit together unmolested,

And words of true love pass from tongue to tongue,

As singing birds from one bough to another.

  Pre. That were a life indeed to make time envious!

I knew that thou wouldst visit me to-night.

I saw thee at the play.

  Vic. Sweet child of air!

Never did I behold thee so attired

And garmented in beauty, as to-night!

What hast thou done to make thee look so fair?

  Pre. Am I not always fair?

  Vic. Aye, and so fair,

That I am jealous of all eyes that see thee,

And wish that they were blind.

  Pre. I heed them not;

When thou art present, I see none but thee!

  Vic. There’s nothing fair nor beautiful, but takes

Something from thee, that makes it beautiful.

  Pre. And yet thou leav’st me for those dusty books.

  Vic. Thou com’st between me and those books too often!

I see thy face in every thing I see!

The paintings in the chapel wear thy looks,

The canticles are changed to sarabands,

And with the learned doctors of the schools

I see thee dance cachuchas.

  Pre. In good sooth,

I dance with the learned doctors of the schools

To-morrow morning.

  Vic. And with whom, I pray?

  Pre. A grave and reverend Cardinal, and his Grace

The Archbishop of Toledo.

  Vic. What mad jest

Is this?

  Pre. It is no jest. Indeed it is not.

  Vic. Pr’ythee, explain thyself.

  Pre. Why simply thus.

Thou knowest the Pope has sent here into Spain

To put a stop to dances on the stage.

  Vic. I’ve heard it whispered.

  Pre. Now the Cardinal,

Who for this purpose comes, would fain behold

With his own eyes these dances: and the Archbishop

Has sent for me.

  Vic. That thou may’st dance before them.

Now viva la cachucha! It will breathe

The fire of youth into these gray old men,

And make them half forget that they are old!

’Twill be thy proudest conquest!

  Pre. Saving one.

And yet I fear the dances will be stopped,

And Preciosa be once more a beggar.

  Vic. The sweetest beggar that e’er asked for alms;

With such beseeching eyes, that when I saw thee

I gave my heart away!

  Pre. Dost thou remember

When first we met?

  Vic. It was at Cordova,

In the Cathedral garden. Thou wast sitting

Under the orange-trees, beside a fountain.

  Pre. ’Twas Easter-Sunday. The full-blossomed trees

Filled all the air with fragrance and with joy.

The priests were singing, and the organ sounded,

And then anon the great Cathedral bell.

It was the elevation of the Host.

We both of us fell down upon our knees,

Under the orange boughs, and prayed together.

I never had been happy, till that moment.

  Vic. Thou blessed angel!

  Pre. And when thou wast gone

I felt an aching here. I did not speak

To any one that day.

  Vic. Sweet Preciosa!

I lov’d thee even then, though I was silent!

  Pre. I thought I ne’er should see thy face again.

Thy farewell had to me a sound of sorrow.

  Vic. That was the first sound in the song of love!

Scarce more than silence is, and yet a sound.

Hands of invisible spirits touch the strings

Of that mysterious instrument, the soul,

And play the prelude of our fate. We hear

The voice prophetic, and are not alone.

  Pre. That is my faith. Dost thou believe these warnings?

  Vic. So far as this. Our feelings and our thoughts

Tend ever on, and rest not in the Present.

As drops of rain fall into some dark well,

And from below comes a scarce audible sound⁠—

So fall our thoughts into the dark Hereafter,

And their mysterious echo reaches us.

  Pre. I’ve felt it so, but found no words to say it!

I cannot reason—I can only feel!

But thou hast language for all thoughts and feelings.

Thou art a scholar: and sometimes I think

We cannot walk together in this world!

The distance that divides us is too great!

Henceforth thy pathway lies among the stars;

I must not hold thee back.

  Vic. Thou little skeptic!

Dost thou still doubt?—What I most prize in woman

Is her affection, not her intellect!

Compare me with the great men of the earth⁠—

What am I? Why, a pigmy among giants!

But if thou lovest—mark me! I say lovest⁠—

The greatest of thy sex excels thee not!

The world of the affections is thy world⁠—

Not that of man’s ambition. In that stillness

Which most becomes a woman, calm and holy,

Thou sittest by the fireside of the heart,

Feeding its flame. The element of fire

Is pure. It cannot change nor hide its nature,

But burns as brightly in a gipsy camp

As in a palace hall. Art thou convinced?

  Pre. Aye, that I love thee, as the good love heaven,

But that I am not worthy of that heaven.

How shall I more deserve it?

  Vic. Loving more.

  Pre. I cannot love thee more; my heart is full.

  Vic. Then let it overflow, and I will drink it,

As in the summer-time the thirsty sands

Drink the swift waters of a mountain torrent,

And still do thirst for more. (Kisses her.)

  A Watchman in the street. Ave Maria

Purissima! ’Tis midnight and serene!

  Vic. Hear’st thou that cry?

  Pre. It is a hateful sound,

To scare thee from me!

  Vic. As the hunter’s horn

Doth scare the timid stag, or bark of hounds

The moor-fowl from his mate.

  Pre. Pray do not go!

  Vic. I must away to Alcalá to-night.

Think of me when I am away.

  Pre. Fear not!

I have no thoughts that do not think of thee.

  Vic. (giving her a ring.) And to remind thee of my love, take this.

A serpent emblem of Eternity,

A ruby,—say, a drop of my heart’s blood.

  Pre. It is an ancient saying, that the ruby

Brings gladness to the wearer, and preserves

The heart pure, and, if laid beneath the pillow,

Drives away evil dreams. But then, alas!

It was a serpent tempted Eve to sin.

  Vic. What convent of barefooted Carmelites

Taught thee so much theology?

  Pre. (laying her hand upon his mouth.) Hush! hush!

Good night! and may all holy angels guard thee!

  Vic. Good night! good night! Thou art my guardian angel!

I have no other saint than thee to pray to!

               (He descends by the balcony.)

  Pre. Take care, and do not hurt thee. Art thou safe?

  Vic. (from the garden.) Safe as my love for thee! But art thou safe?

Others can climb a balcony by moonlight

As well as I. Pray, shut thy window close;

I’m jealous of the perfumed air of night

That from this garden climbs to kiss thy lips.

  Pre. (throwing down her handkerchief.) Thou silly child!

Take this to blind thine eyes.

It is my benison!

  Vic. And brings to me

Sweet fragrance from thy lips, as the soft wind

Wafts to the out-bound mariner the breath

Of the beloved land he leaves behind.

  Pre. Make not thy voyage long.

  Vic. To-morrow night

Shall see me safe returned. Thou art the star

To guide me to an anchorage. Good night!

My beauteous star! My star of love, good night!

  Pre. Good night!

  Watchman. (at a distance.) Ave Maria Purissima!</em></p>
